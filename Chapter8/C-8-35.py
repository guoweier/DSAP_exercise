# Two ordered trees T' and T'' are said to be isomorphic if one of the following holds:
# - Both T' and T'' are empty.
# - The roots of T' and T'' have the same number k >= 0 of substrees, and the ith such subtree of T' is isomorphic to the ith such subtree of T'' for i=1,2,3...k
# Design an algorithm that test whether two given ordered trees are isomorphic. What is the running time of your algorithm?
