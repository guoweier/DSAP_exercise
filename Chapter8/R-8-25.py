# Consider the example of a breadth-first traversal given in Figure 8.17, Using the annotated numbers from that figure, describe the contents of the queue before each pass of the while loop in Code Fragment 8.14. To get started, the queue has contents {1} before the first pass, and contents {2,3,4} before the second pass.

# {1}
# {2,3,4}
# {3,4,5,6}
# {4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11}
# {5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16}
# {6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16}
# ...
# {16}
# {}
