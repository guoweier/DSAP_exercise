# Draw an arithmetic expression tree that has four external nodes, storing the numbers 1, 5, 6 and 7 (with each number sotred in a distinct external node, bit not neccessarily in this order), and has three internal nodes, each storing an expression from the set {+,-,x,/}, so that the value of the root is 21. The operation may return and act on fractions, and an operator may be used more than once.

# 6/(1-5/7)
#     /
#  6    -
#     1   /
#       5  7
