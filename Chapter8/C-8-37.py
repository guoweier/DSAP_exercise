# If we exclude isomorphic trees (see Exercise C-8-35), exactly how many proper trees exist with exactly 4 leaves?

# 1.
#      1
#   2     3
# 4  5  6   7

# 2.
#        1
#     2     3
#   4   5
# 6  7

# 3.
#        1
#     2     3
#   4   5
#     6  7

# 4.
#        1
#     2     3
#         4   5
#       6  7

# 5.
#        1
#     2     3
#         4   5
#           6  7

# So in total there are 5 proper trees exist with exactly 4 leaves.
