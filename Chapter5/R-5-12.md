**Describe how the built-in sum function can be combined with Python's comprehensin syntax to compute the sum of all numbers in an n x n data set, represented as a list of list.**

The n x n matrix is exhibited as:  
[[a11, a12, a13, a14, ... a1n],  
[a21, a22, a23, a24, ... a2n],  
...  
[an1, an2, an3, an4, ... ann]]

The sum() function can be used for calculating the sum of all elements in a list. However, sum() cannot be used to calculate the sum of a list of lists.  

So I use a for loop to get every list in the matrix, and use sum() function to calculate the sum value for each element. Then append() the sum into a list. Finally, after all the list element has been checked, use sum() function to the list with previous calculated values.  

The algorithm has been implemented in R-5-11.py.
