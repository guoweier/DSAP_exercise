# To better model a FIFO queue in which entries may be deleted before reaching the front, design a PositionalQueue class that supports the complete queue ADT, yet with enqueue returning a position instance and support for a new method, delete(p), that removes the element associated with position p from the queue. You may use the adapter design pattern (Section 6.1.2), using a PositionalList as your storage.
