# In Code Fragment 6.5 we assume that opening tags in HTML have form <name>, as with <li>. More generally, HTML allows optional attributes to be expressed as part of an opening tag. The general form used is <name attribute1="value1" atturbute2="value2">; for example, a table can be given a border and additional padding by using an opening tag of <table border="3" cellpadding="5">. Modify Code Fragment 6.5 so that it can properly match tags, even when an opening tag may include one or more such attributes.
